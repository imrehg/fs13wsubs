1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
RABBITLAND

2
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,462
Rabbitland.

3
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,005
Nothing can change the wonderful impression.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rabbits live in comfy pink homes.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Rabbits are happy.

6
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,610
And since they have no brains,
just holes in their heads 

7
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,000
Nothing bad can happen to them.

8
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,913
They are the most perfect and highest stage in evolution.

9
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:49,841
Rabbits rise very early each morning,

10
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:54,493
put heavy blank sheets of paper 
in the holes in their heads,

11
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:03,000
gather around the huge golden monument 

12
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,041
and patiently wait for

13
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,391
the play button to be pressed. 

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then, slowly and orderly, they start.

15
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,141
The journey is long

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,042
suprising 

17
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,000
with many obstacles

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,794
IQ measuring points, but

19
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:20,000
despite that, the Rabbits travel slowly and dutifully, 

20
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,500
with a clear goal. 

21
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:32,554
They go far, far away, 
up to the borders of Rabbitland,

22
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,000
even though beyond them there is nothing

23
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:51,000
but only empty areas, inhabited by

24
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:53,200
Evil Girls.

25
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,983
They go so far to vote at the elections,

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,917
 which in Rabbitland take place once a day,

27
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:08,000
because it is a well-ordered democracy.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Remarkably easily,

29
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,839
one by one,

30
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,517
they insert the ballots

31
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:22,195
into a tall, tall ballot box.

32
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:54,000
The Evil Girls know that every vote is a vote for them.

33
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:07,839
The Rabbits return home full of joy. 

34
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then, the Evil Girls press stop,

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and the evening comes to Rabbitland.

36
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,161
The Rabbits go to sleep.

37
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,670
But, having no brain, they can't sleep.

38
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so they watch the election results
 on TV the whole night.

39
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,800
At the borders of Rabbitland, the Evil Girls play 

40
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:11,678
and they laugh at another senseless day.

41
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:16,568
The Rabbits are happy.

42
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,965
Happy day in Rabbitland.

43
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,609
happy

44
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,973
happy

45
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,161
happy
