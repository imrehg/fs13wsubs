1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,700
<i>Hi.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,980
<i>I'm looking for a seed.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,820
<i>Red, small.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,940
<i>A little seed, this big.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,580
<i>Grows into a round plant,

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,460
<i>this high...

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,020
<i>Does it flower?

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,820
<i>No, you can't eat it.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,220
<i>The plant is about this high.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,540
<i>Is it sold here?

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>I was told I could buy it here.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,540
<i>Where can I buy it?

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
<i>Where can I buy it?

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>It's too late.
-Ok, thanks.

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,980
<i>Hi, I'm looking for a little red seed.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,100
<i>A little seed.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,220
<i>I don't know its name.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,900
<i>What?

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,460
<i>What?

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,940
<i>No, that's not it. A seed.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,780
<i>That I'm falling?

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,380
<i>That's why he's so fat.
During the day he barely eats.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,340
<i>His body goes on high alert.

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,100
<i>When he pigs out at night

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,460
<i>his body thinks
it needs to absorb everything.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,580
<i>So it's better
to eat a little at a time.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,980
<i>Are you listening?

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,660
<i>Yes. All the way down?

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
<i>Yes.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,260
<i>Know where it is?

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,660
<i>No.

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>I'm hungry.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,460
Thanks.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,020
<i>Why show my feelings
if we never talk?

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,260
What're they doing?

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,780
<i>I think they're going out.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,420
<i>No, guys like you.

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,580
<i>What do you mean?

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,780
I think I'll skip work tomorrow.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,420
You always say that.

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,300
Look, I cut my finger.

42
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,900
That's normal.

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,900
Normal for you, not for me.

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,300
You drinking a beer?

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,540
Are you kidding? Obviously.

46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,980
I can't see, but I can smell it.

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,300
You can't see?

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,780
<i>My eyes need to adjust.

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,660
<i>Let's play "Say it, win it!"

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,660
You lie.

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
What?

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,060
<i>He's a big liar.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,420
It's no fun playing with you.

54
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,420
<i>My shoes!
-Take them off.

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,740
<i>Let's order pizza.
It'll do us good.

56
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,220
Go for it.

57
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,980
Yep.

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Cool.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,860
I dreamt air was like dough.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
What?

61
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,060
Bread dough.
-Raw?

62
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,700
And I destroyed myself
to understand.

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,860
What are you doing?

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,460
Nothing.

65
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,940
Say it, win it.

66
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,780
I thought you were making fun of me.

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,540
<i>Why show my feelings
if we never talk?

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,140
I don't want to go.

69
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,140
So what's your hurry?

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,340
No other openings.

71
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,980
Oh well.

72
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,420
She's a bitch.

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,180
My shoulder hurts.

74
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Look.

75
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,700
Did she do that?

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,340
Indirectly, yes.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,300
Sure this is the way?

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,700
Vacation is no vacation
if I keep doing the same thing.

79
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,940
Are you listening?

80
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,860
Got the flowers?

81
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,740
Yep.

82
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,460
Where'd you put them?

83
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,900
Tell me.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,180
Deep inside in total safety.

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
That way I'm sure they're safe.

86
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,140
Spare me the details.

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,860
Want some?

88
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,420
No, thanks.

89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,900
What?
That you should put it in the bag.

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,980
Oh, I heard it, 
you said jungle.

91
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,380
So, are you coming tonight ?

92
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,980
I don't think so,
I don't have any money.

93
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,380
Don't worry, I'll lend you.

94
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,740
No, it's ok
if I don't have, I don't have.

95
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,380
Hey, Archie !

96
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,940
What's up?

97
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm good.

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,820
- Are you coming this way ?
- Yes, I'm going home.

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,900
I forgot to tell I was coming late.

100
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,700
- So you where with Kinny last night ?
- No ...

101
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,140
Ah, he texted me that they 
were doing a party downstairs.

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,700
But I was already on my bed, 
eating cheese, drunk,

103
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,540
so I didn't feel like going.

104
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I turned off the lights, phone, everything.
I dissapeared.

105
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,860
I think I'm getting old.

106
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,060
So you're not coming tonight?
 I don't think so.

107
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,980
I think he wants to spend time 
with Alf and Bobby.

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,540
Stop lying!

109
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,100
I bought a new plant. It's funny.

110
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,540
This tree is new too, right?
-Yes.

111
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,020
And why is it funny?

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,220
You never know how
it'll act with you.

113
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,500
What's it called?

114
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,140
Armadillo tail.

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,500
What's it do

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,500
Makes me want 
to see pictures of girls.

117
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,060
Girls?
-Yep.

118
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,420
Have you talked to Paul ?

119
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,980
No ...
 Sorry

120
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,580
I've not been able to talk to Paul 

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,980
because I've got no light 
for some days now.

122
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,500
Ah, so you're still without light

123
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,380
- Yeah, twenty days !
- Twenty days ?

124
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,140
You can come to my house if you want.
-Ok.

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
Mabel !

126
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,180
- What are you doing here ?
- Hey ! Where are you going ?

127
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,900
- I'm going to school, you ? 
-I'm going to work.

128
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,940
- Oh, that's nice.
- I don't know.

129
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,260
-You don't know what ? 
- Going to work ...

130
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,340
Ok, come this way.

131
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,020
Is it this way to your school ?

132
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,460
No. I come here when
 I don't want to go to school.

133
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,500
I want to know about music,

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,940
 and download music.

135
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,780
- You want?
- No.

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm ok.

137
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,900
In what could I specialize?

138
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,620
Maybe you could work 
in a supermarket.

139
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,300
Yes ! I will learn
 more about music there.

140
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,900
In what could I specialize?

141
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,180
Are you listening ?

142
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Doctor, I think this guy is lying.

143
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,380
But it's not important.

144
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
Really?

145
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,260
Do we need to find 
a psychiatrist for him?

146
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,220
Not that much.

147
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,220
Tell him to go out.

148
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Please !

149
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,180
It's just a minute.

150
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,180
<i>I've got all the papers !

151
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,740
<i>I won't come again, 

152
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,500
<i>I swear.

153
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,700
Was that already here?
Is it new?

154
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,300
I need more money.

155
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,860
<i>Soon.

156
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
I still don't believe
in reincarnation.

157
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,380
Ten more.

158
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,660
<i>Three...

159
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,940
<i>Well... five.

160
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,140
Sleeping in the daytime isn't sleep.

161
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,500
When I was little 
I said "dead" for "bed".

162
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,580
<i>Find the seeds?

163
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,700
<i>Another time
you might fall in love with me.
