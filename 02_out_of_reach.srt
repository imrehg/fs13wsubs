1
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:21,701
Hi, and I think we should say ''goodbye''
 because the filming is over. 

2
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:23,122
Why?

3
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:33,375
We've just talked to our father.
 He doesn't want to participate in this film anymore. 

4
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:40,397
It was fine with him as long as he could tell you 
exactly what to do and what to show. 

5
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:47,049
He wanted to glorify himself in front of the camera
 but the truth is we quarrel all the time 

6
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:50,775
and we can hardly make ends meet. 

7
00:00:56,606 --> 00:01:00,669
So, what are you going to do with
 the medical examination of your eyes?

8
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:04,962
I have no idea.

9
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:11,058
I would have to tell him that you want
 to help me with it.

10
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:14,202
And, you'll tell him that.

11
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,048
Out of reach

12
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:28,011
I'm with Karolina now. We've been watching 
some photos on the computer.

13
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:30,012
And?

14
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:35,929
Something's wrong with my eyes. 
When I sit in front of the computer, I get a terrible headache. 

15
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,261
And?

16
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:45,085
Karolina smsed Kuba yesterday and asked him
 if he could help us 

17
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:50,950
with arranging the medical examination of my eyes.

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,612
And?

19
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:56,078
And, he agreed but it has to be our decision. 

20
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,393
But why are you arranging things behind my back?  

21
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,128
Karolina wrote to him, not me. 

22
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,070
You are really messing up things. 

23
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,284
What do you mean?

24
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:13,002
O.K. He can help you 
with the medical examination, but I don't want to have anything to do with him.

25
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,943
I don't want to do anything against you.
 That's why I'm asking you. 

26
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:26,254
Karolina wrote to him and he agreed to help, 
but I want to have your permission first.

27
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:33,070
O.K. So, go and do it, but I don't want to 
see him anymore. There will be no more filming!

28
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:38,488
So, you've decided to come here with your sister, right?

29
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:40,974
Yes.

30
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:48,643
You're 16. Why did't you come with your parents?

31
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:58,892
Hold this book, all right? 
Now, look at it and tell me what you can see. 

32
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:06,755
There are smaller signs here and bigger signs over there.

33
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,226
I can only see a different colour here. 

34
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,003
All right.

35
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:18,738
I'm showing you my hand now.
 How many fingers can you see?

36
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:20,013
I don't know.

37
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:23,933
And now? Can you see my hand?

38
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:32,991
I can see it now.

39
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,006
Can you count my fingers?
 How many fingers can you see with your left eye?

40
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:41,181
I can't tell.

41
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,876
And now? Can you see anything?

42
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:48,745
No.

43
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:58,411
Usually, it's possible for an eye to recover provided
 the problem is taken care of by the parents 

44
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,964
because you are still a child, aren't you?

45
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:11,850
The problem, however, was ignored.
 The eye wasn't attended to with sufficient care 

46
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:17,962
and now it doesn't function at all. 

47
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:26,925
You're now 16 and for the last 16 years
 your eyesight has been deteriorating. 

48
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,998
This means that it won't be possible for you to see
 with your left eye at all.  

49
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,919
Stop crying.

50
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,955
I have no plans for the future. Life is life.

51
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:06,496
You're in a shitty situation because you're only 16. 

52
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:09,745
I am sure I'll leave home sooner than you.

53
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,025
Do you want to bet?

54
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,864
Sure. A hundred zloty. 

55
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:32,969
There was one card. Actually, it was not a card
 but a big cup made of cardstock 

56
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:39,029
that we prepared for the Father's Day. 

57
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:48,998
We gave it to him with a note 
''for the best father in the world''. 

58
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:54,928
It was the only thing that 
we really wanted to prepare for him.
 

59
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,967
And, we did it out of our own will.

60
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:09,952
That's your handwriting: ''Dad, on this joyous day I wish you 
good health, best of luck and may God bless you. 

61
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,930
I want you to be happy for the next thousand years and 
I hope you’ll spend this time with Mum''. 

62
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,711
Sentence on behalf of the Republic of Poland
 against Bożena Siankowska. 

63
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,807
And, we've got the reference number. 

64
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,896
Another reference number.

65
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,638
This is what we're looking for.

66
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:37,952
So, we need to borrow it from Dad.

67
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:40,968
It's enough if we copy it. 

68
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:47,910
We can find her ID number at the Citizens Advice Bureau 
or take it from Grandma. 

69
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,974
Why would they give us our mother's ID number 
at the Citizens Advice Bureau?

70
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,912
We'll just tell them that we're looking for our mother.

71
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,034
Come in.

72
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,953
Good morning.

73
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:18,527
We've got little information about our mother because
 Klaudia was 2.5 and I was 3.5 years old when she left us 

74
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:21,964
and we still don't know where she is. 

75
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:28,722
Klaudia met our cousins who said she'd been put to jail. 

76
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:30,997
We don't know if she's in Poland or abroad. 

77
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,968
We also heard gossips that she'd been deported to Poland 
and was in prison somewhere here. 

78
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:41,792
We have no access to any documents.

79
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,482
Does she use your father’s surname or her maiden name?

80
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:48,982
No idea. After the wedding, 
she used our father's name. 

81
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,979
 Actually, they didn't divorce. 
It was ''annulment of marriage''. 

82
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,987
She could have used her maiden name. 

83
00:07:56,015 --> 00:08:01,984
We don't know that. She was pursued by police
 when the divorce case was still in court. 

84
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,806
She didn't come to court for the marriage annulment verdict.

85
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:12,972
We just want to know if she's alive, 
what's going on with her and where she is

86
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:20,989
According to the penal code, as the injured party 
you have access to the court files. 

87
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:26,995
I suggest you should go to court 
and browse through the files

88
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,932
to find all the possible information about your mother.  

89
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,047
This may help you get in touch with her.

90
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:46,880
Welcome to our sanctuary. Our alcohol den. 

91
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,984
So, we've arrived at the place where we drink, have parties…

92
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,246
Where it smells.

93
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:08,892
Where we sleep, play cards, play chess…

94
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:10,468
This is not me. 

95
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:11,300
This is you.

96
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:12,481
This is not me.

97
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:12,977
This is you.

98
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:18,454
Klaudia, I remember having 
a completely different outfit at that time. 

99
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:20,998
I was so pretty.

100
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,956
Oh, yes. A real beauty. Wait a second!

101
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,699
Give me some of them.
You're goimg through them so slowly.

102
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:35,962
We don't have many memories of our Mum. 
I don't remember what she actually looked like. 

103
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:41,580
There was only one time when she came to visit us. 
There are only three photos here.

104
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:46,989
She showed up once to give us the bicycles
 and she was wearing this white dress.

105
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,656
Yes, a ''superman costume''.

106
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:56,972
It was a white, semi-transparent cloth
 and she had long blond hair. 

107
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:04,729
She was wearing sunglasses to hide her black eyes. 
Do you remember this gold bracelet she was wearing?

108
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:06,525
Yes, rings and earrings.

109
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:11,070
Then, it turned out that she robbed a jeweller.

110
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:16,755
If I was to see Bożena again, I would…

111
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:21,248
She would tell you the same thing: 
''Sweetie, I had no choice''.

112
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,022
I would kick her ass. 
I wouldn't listen to her chattering. 

113
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,996
I would pay her back for all the 16 years
 when she wasn’t here on Mother's Day… 

114
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,266
Nobody would be able to calm me down. 

115
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:39,313
Maybe violence is not the best way out,
 but kicking her ass would make me feel better. 

116
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,806
It'd be a miracle if I didn't kill her. 

117
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:49,920
Good morning.

118
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,267
Good morning. Come in, please.

119
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,651
Forty one.

120
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:03,545
Thirty four. Forty one. Here?

121
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,744
Aha.

122
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,245
Good morning. Can we come in?

123
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,546
Come in, please.

124
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:20,435
The father doesn't know where his wife is
 although he tried to find her. 

125
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:25,334
Her friends refused to inform him where she is. 

126
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,317
The father stopped drinking two years ago. 
He is a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

127
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:40,571
 He believes other members of the AA group support him.

128
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:47,835
The father seems to care for his daughters.
 Bożena Siankowska has been deprived of her parental rights.

129
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:54,354
She isn't interested in her daughters and doesn't contact them.

130
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,723
How come her ID number is not in the files? 

131
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,801
What do you mean?

132
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:10,550
You can change your place of residence, but not your ID number!

133
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,479
Whose fault is it then?

134
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:16,492
It's the court's fault. 
They should have the basic data.

135
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,531
You always want to have everything right away.

136
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:25,004
Good morning. This is Bożena speaking. 
Please leave the message.

137
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:40,595
Hi, Mum. We're having a walk with Tola now. 

138
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:48,901
We need to talk about our trip. 
So, call me or I'll call you later. Bye.

139
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:54,928
We've been in touch with her for only two weeks
 now and she wants to meet us now? 

140
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,549
I don't even know this woman and
 I'm supposed to visit her abroad?

141
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:03,101
It's more difficult for you because 
you don't even remember her. 

142
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:08,135
She hasn't given us enough time
 to accept the fact that she’s with us again. 

143
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,432
She wants to buy us one-way tickets. 

144
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,538
We can come only if we have return tickets. 

145
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:23,209
If we have return tickets and more time to think it over. 
Not just two weeks.

146
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,786
So, she called you first or what?

147
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,534
I called her first because I stole her phone number 
from Grandma's mobile.

148
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,504
And, what did you tell her?

149
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:39,483
At first it was the answering machine.
 Then, I gave Tola her phone number. 

150
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:47,484
Tola smsed her and Bożena called her back. 

151
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,007
After they talked, Tola was crying.

152
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:57,490
I was furious because Bożena didn't call me at all. 

153
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:03,385
I texted her to tell her how bad I felt 
about it and she called me back immediately.

154
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:04,417
And?

155
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,656
She started crying and giving excuses 
for what she did in the past.

156
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:17,131
She's abandoned you and now 
she suddenly wants you to visit her? 

157
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:22,024
She last saw you when you were 3 and now you're 18. 

158
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:26,524
Maybe she'll contact you again when you turn 30?

159
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:36,806
Aren't you afraid that after you meet her,
 she'll disappear from your life again? 

160
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:40,452
Aren't you going to suffer even more?

161
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,021
I know it's risky.

162
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:50,181
She's been in touch with everyone else but you. 

163
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:55,238
She could have talked to you just for a second
 to see what you're like. 

164
00:14:55,671 --> 00:15:01,179
She's forgotten about you 
and now you want to hit the fucking road?

165
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:05,257
Just to see Paris? To see what she's like?

166
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:08,841
I don't know if I should go or not…

167
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:15,345
Don't you worry about anything.
 Now you're with Dad. I'll help if I can. 

168
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:25,405
I'll send you money from time to time. 
If you want, you can come here in five or six months. 

169
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:30,861
Karolina will come first and see what it's like here. Hello?

170
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,819
I'm here.

171
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:41,245
She can stay with me because I live alone.
 I've got a job. 

172
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:49,838
I haven't told this to Karolina, but I think 
she's going through a hard time now. 

173
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,970
I think she has my character.

174
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,637
You're absolutely right.

175
00:15:56,142 --> 00:16:05,960
That's my impression of her. I've tried to learn from 
my own mistakes and I want her to do the same. 

176
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:10,981
I don't want you girls to make similar mistakes
 like me and your father. 

177
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:18,367
I'd like you to settle down,
 but Karolina seems to be very much like me.

178
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:27,603
That's why I'd like her to come here. 
Maybe I could help by telling her about 

179
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:36,096
the mistakes I've made. 
We haven't seen each other for such a long time. 

180
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,544
Right.

181
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:43,864
We have a chance to change things for better. 
And then, we'll see…

182
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:49,734
How will we recognize each other at the airport?

183
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,468
I'm 160 cm tall and I'm a blonde.

184
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,188
I'm slim and I weigh 48 kg.

185
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,859
What a starveling!

186
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:01,410
What?

187
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:05,129
So, you're quite thin. Thinner that me. 

188
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:06,968
And, how much do you weigh?

189
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,780
52kg.

190
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760


191
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,989
Almost my weight. How about your hair? Is it long?

192
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:16,037
Shoulder length.

193
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,137
I have longer hair.

194
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:23,178
Last time I saw you, you also had long hair.

195
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,359
Who is it?

196
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:29,131
What?

197
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,734
Who was it?

198
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:39,329
It's a friend of mine. He drove me home.
 I've told him my children are coming over. 

199
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:48,890
He'd like to say ''hello'' to you,
 but you don't speak French or English. 

200
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,008
Wait a second. I'll give him the phone
 so you can tell him ''hello''.

201
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:54,819
Hello.

202
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,592
Fuck off.

203
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:16,464
It's my first flight. This is my reservation. 
Where shall I go? 

204
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,708
Where are you flying?

205
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:18,710
To Paris.

206
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,006
It's not possible to say what you're going to feel 
and what she's going to feel. 

207
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,951
I'm going to tell her to keep her hands away from me.

208
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,498
I wonder what she looks like.

209
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:43,708
How did she describe herself? Blond hair, 160 cm tall.

210
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,004
Just like me.

211
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:50,285
She described herself very precisely. 

212
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:59,579
I need to go. Take care. Say ''hello'' to Kasia and her son. 
We'll sms each other.

213
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,802
Goodbye my love. 

214
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:20,034
I wonder what she looks like and how they will
 get on with each other. 

215
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:24,622
Karolina will need at least three days
 to tell me everything about it. 

216
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:31,164
What Bożena looks like, what they did, where they went. 

217
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,672
I take care of Philip for 5 to 6 hours every day. 

218
00:19:55,078 --> 00:20:02,063
Witek comes to collect him after work 
and then takes him to Kasia.

219
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:07,145
Would you like to have your own child in the future?

220
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:15,084
In the future, yes. And, more than one.

221
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:32,827
She hasn't seen me for several years
 and now the boss won't let her pick me up. 

222
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:40,377
She could have taken a short break
 to collect me from the airport. Pity. 

223
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:47,320
We're going to the centre of Paris now.
 I hope we'll see each other  tonight or tomorrow. 

224
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:52,709
She told me she didn't work on Sundays, 
but then she said she did…

225
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:18,500
It's a crazy place. Millions of people, pubs, 
residences, monuments. Fuck! 

226
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,491
It's really incredible.

227
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:29,292
Tola is going to regret she hasn't come here.

228
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:47,693
It's better for me and Karolina to go separately. 
Karolina has her own questions to ask and I have my own. 

229
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:53,261
Bożena will have more time to talk to us
 if we come separately. 

230
00:21:53,478 --> 00:22:00,356
If we attacked her with too many questions together,
 she'd feel overwhelmed. 

231
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:06,309
It could be too much of a shock for her. 
So, Karolina will talk to her first 

232
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,277
and then I'll go and ask her my questions.
 I think everything should be fine. 

233
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,492
Hello.

234
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:18,957
Hi Mum.

235
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:21,408
Hi Karolinka.

236
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:24,438
I was calling you yesterday. You didn't answer.

237
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:27,017
I left my mobile at work.

238
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:29,475
Have you read my message?

239
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,941
I haven't checked the messages. 
They brought my phone in the morning. 

240
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:37,048
I'm going to take a bath now and we'll meet later on. 

241
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:44,920
Listen, I’ve got something to do now. Let’s meet at 5 o’clock by the Eiffel Tower.

242
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:45,996
O.K.

243
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,841
Fine. My heart's beating so hard. What?

244
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,880
So, 5 o'clock by the Eiffel Tower. 

245
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:55,415
Right.

246
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:57,223
How do you like it here?

247
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:01,326
It's nice. A totally different world.

248
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:06,497
It seems nice to tourists, but it's different 
for people who work here.

249
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,405
I guess so.

250
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:19,300
I can see that she misses us and really cares.
 She's interested in how we live. 

251
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:26,498
It looks good. Maybe not everything is perfect,
 but it's a good start. 

252
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:32,071
It's difficult to meet somebody who 
abandoned you many years ago.

253
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:40,402
You hate this person, 
but you're also somehow attracted to her. 

254
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:49,342
You just feel it's the right moment to meet up,
but it’s very difficult emotionally. 

255
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:57,080
My hands are trembling. I feel like fainting.
 Thousands of thoughts are racing through my head.

256
00:23:57,475 --> 00:24:02,251
I can control myself now but when we meet
 I won't be able to utter a word. 

257
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:08,732
I'll just stand still and stare at her. 
Sorry, I need a drink. 

258
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,812
Right next to the entrance. Can you hear me?

259
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,157
The entrance to where?

260
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:29,217
There's a white kiosk here. On your way from… What?

261
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:30,766
By the stairs?

262
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,654
Fuck, I don't see any stairs here.

263
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:35,926
You don't?

264
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,685
I don't. Wait. There's a sign over there. Jesus… What?

265
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,178
Are you by the Eiffel Tower now?

266
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:56,663
Yes. Let's meet right in the middle
 beneath the Eiffel Tower, O.K.?

267
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:58,473
O.K. How are you dressed?

268
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:03,366
Dark brown trousers and a red-brown-white top.

269
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:29,974
I'm glad I've recorded this video-letter for her. 
She'll have an opportunity to see me. 

270
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:36,409
She'll meet Karolina, but she'll also see me. 

271
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:43,884
I wonder what her reaction will be
 when she sees me on tape.

272
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:36,728
Good morning. This is Bożena. Please, leave your message.

273
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:13,024
I've always wanted to have a mother. 

274
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:21,345
I haven't had my mother for so many years 
because you've been away. I hope it'll change now. 

275
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:26,247
I don't want you to show up for 5 minutes 
and then disappear for another 14 years. 

276
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:31,217
I want you to stay with me for good. 

277
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:43,853
Many people have told me that I look just like you. 

278
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:50,130
The same height, same hair, same eyes.
 We'll see if it’s true.
