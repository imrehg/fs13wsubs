1
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,030
Ahmad!

2
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,200
- How are you doing?
- What's up, Rafi?

3
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,070
How have you been? How's your health?

4
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,220
I brought you some hot coals.

5
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,080
Where have you been all week?

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,130
Sakhi saw me stealing from his shop,
so I had to hide out for a while.

7
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,120
How's work?

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,170
Not bad. But I have to get back — my father's waiting.

9
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,190
- Let's hang out today.
- There’s no way my dad will let me.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,070
Oh, come on, take the day off.

11
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,080
Rafi! What are you doing?

12
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,080
I was getting water.

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,000
Get back to the shop.

14
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,180
I'll see you later.

15
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,180
Get out of here, bastard.

16
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,050
Let me bless you! My smoke cures the evil eye!

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Quick! Get out your money!

18
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,190
May you become a mullah!
May you own three Corollas!

19
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,230
Mister, a blessing!

20
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,140
Uncle, let me bless you. Come on.

21
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,150
Just 5 or 10 rupees!

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,030
Come on, uncle!

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,060
What about you? Just one blessing!

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,230
I will pray that you get a better car!

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,060
Father, can I get some time off this afternoon?

26
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,010
Eat your food. We have work to do.

27
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm full.

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Clean up these plates, then.

29
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,090
Rafi, my son.

30
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,400
Yes?

31
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,000
You have two hours.

32
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,160
- I was about to leave without you.
- You wouldn't have done that.

33
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,050
All the best buzkashi riders will be competing.

34
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
You're going to love it.

35
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,170
Come on, hurry!

36
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
All aboard! Last stop, Sar-e-Kotal!

37
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,080
Look over there.

38
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,190
He's got the goat!

39
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,210
A buzkashi rider grabs the goat,
then they fight over it all the way to the flag.

40
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,010
Once the rider goes around the flag,
he takes the goat back to the circle.

41
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,000
That's how you score a point.

42
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,030
He's got it! He's got it!

43
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,220
Go! Go!

44
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,130
Look! He's bringing it back to the circle!

45
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,080
Go! Go!

46
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,080
Come on!

47
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,020
He made it!

48
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,150
Attention all spectators!

49
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,070
They are as fast as deer, as focused as tigers .. 

50
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,050
.. as quick as jackrabbits, and as fit as foxes!

51
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,060
All buzkashi riders in Afghanistan ..

52
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,140
.. from the North, from the South, from the West!

53
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,020
Cheer for these champions!

54
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,030
Look at that. I got one!

55
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,010
Lucky shot.

56
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,180
No more points for lucky shots.

57
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,210
At least I made it.

58
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,200
- I made it again! Was that one lucky?
- Of course.

59
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,100
That's how a real man throws it.

60
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,210
Don't get too excited over one shot.

61
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,000
I've made two to your one.

62
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,090
I'm still the champion, though.

63
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,130
You know what? One day I will be a buzkashi rider.

64
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,180
How are you going to do that?

65
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,050
You think I'm going to be on the streets forever?

66
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,160
You don't have a horse.
You need a horse to be a buzkashi rider.

67
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,210
Don't worry, I have a plan.

68
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,130
One day the announcer will call out my name
in front of everyone.

69
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,090
I'll be remembered as a buzkashi champion.

70
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
You have big dreams.

71
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,060
I know what my future will be.

72
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm going to be a blacksmith like my father.

73
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,230
Nothing can change that.

74
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,180
You're wrong. You can do anything you want.

75
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
Come on. I want to show you something.

76
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Whose palace was this?

77
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,210
Who cares?

78
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,190
I think it was some king.

79
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Come on.

80
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,110
Where are we going?

81
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,010
Go ahead, climb up.

82
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,120
Go on.

83
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,090
I can't.

84
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,210
You always say that.

85
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,180
This is how you do it.

86
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,150
Ahmad, be careful, you'll fall.

87
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
Look, it's easy. Don't worry so much.

88
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,010
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

89
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,200
If you can't climb up here,
what kind of buzkashi rider will you be?

90
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,110
You'll be a blacksmith all your life.

91
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,010
My name is Ahmad, son of Abdullah!

92
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,210
And I will be a buzkashi rider!

93
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,040
I have to get back to the shop.

94
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,010
My father's waiting.

95
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,030
See you later.

96
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,020
Wait a minute.

97
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,030
What?

98
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,110
Oh, wow.

99
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,190
Where did you get this?

100
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,210
I got it from a buzkashi rider.

101
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,180
When did you meet a buzkashi rider?

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,220
Here, wear it like this.

103
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,000
This way your dad won't see it.

104
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,050
If you keep it with you all the time,
you'll be strong enough to ride buzkashi.

105
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,160
Now go.

106
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,070
Remember that you don't have to be a blacksmith.

107
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,130
Right.

108
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,120
See you tomorrow.

109
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,080
Goodbye.

110
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,030
Where were you?

111
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,230
You were with that fatherless beggar again, no?

112
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,170
Listen to me.

113
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,210
I want these sharp enough to shave with.

114
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,020
And you'll have no dinner tonight. Get started.

115
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,030
Rafi.

116
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,160
It's late. Go to sleep.

117
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,050
My grandfather was a blacksmith.

118
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,030
So was my father.

119
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,170
I was your age when I first picked up a hammer.

120
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,110
A blacksmith lives an honorable life.

121
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,020
Rafi.

122
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,070
What?

123
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,010
Come on, I want to show you something.

124
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,190
Okay.

125
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,130
Let's go.

126
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,230
So, are you a master blacksmith yet?

127
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,190
All I do is sharpen axe heads.

128
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,150
You think you can swing a hammer with those scrawny arms?

129
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,210
Laugh it up.

130
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,160
Where are we going?

131
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,000
Be patient. It's a surprise.

132
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,020
We're going up there.

133
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,070
Come on.

134
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,170
Hey there.

135
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,020
You're a beauty.

136
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,020
You're a real beauty.

137
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,060
Take this.

138
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,020
What are you doing?

139
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,230
Stop! What are you doing?,

140
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,070
Get down!

141
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,170
You said I needed a horse to ride buzkashi.

142
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,130
Now I have one!

143
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,070
<i>Praise God the great and merciful ..

144
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,150
Let's go.

145
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,170
Take the hammer.

146
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,020
We need to shape the axe head. Hit it here.

147
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,110
What kind of hammering is that, boy?

148
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,180
Hit it like that.

149
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,080
You're not listening.

150
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,180
Like this.

151
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,000
Here, you do it.

152
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,170
What are you doing?

153
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,070
Is that how you hammer?

154
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,540
Son!

155
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Rafi!

156
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,140
Ahmad!

157
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,040
Where were you, boy?

158
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,130
You said you would teach me.

159
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,140
Will you teach me now?

160
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,070
Good job.

161
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Well done.
